# map2kcal
Process .gpx route to useful information (like activity energy depletion) in JavaScript

The library loads route coordinates from .gpx file then based on downloaded data (elevations, highways, surfaces, weather) and set exercise (cycling, running, walking) calculates many different values (headwind, crosswind, different energy types, calories burned, etc.).

There is no documentation yet. See sample.html for some details about usage. Besides coordinates, every other value is presented in SI units (unless named explicitly).
